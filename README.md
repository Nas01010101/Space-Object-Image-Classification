# Space-Object-Image-Classification
This repository contains a comprehensive deep learning system for classifying space objects (satellites, debris, planets, stars) from images using convolutional neural networks. The project implements both custom CNN architectures and transfer learning approaches with pre-trained models like ResNet50 and MobileNetV2.
