# Space-Object-Image-Classification
This repository aims to eventually contain a comprehensive deep learning system for classifying space objects (satellites, debris, planets, stars) from images using convolutional neural networks. The project implements both custom CNN architectures and transfer learning approaches with pre-trained models like ResNet50 and MobileNetV2.

Requirements

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.4+
NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
PIL, Pandas, Seaborn
TQDM

Future Work

Integration of additional model architectures (EfficientNet, Vision Transformer)
Web UI for easy image upload and classification
Real-time classification for video streams
Object detection to identify multiple space objects in a single image
